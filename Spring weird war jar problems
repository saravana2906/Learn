Issue : 
JSP with jar package with embedded tomcat is not properly supported in Spring boot . Sometimes you try to convert to war , controller function will execute , but return view will not resolve. Tried many things updating JRE in eclipse with installed JDK .No use.
Verified prefix and suffix , everything good but couldn't find any problem.
Diagnosis:
used --debug flag with run configuration in eclipse couldn't pinpoint the issue, then used --trace flag and able to pinpoint that prefix and suffix configuration given in application properties file is not taking in.
It would be problem due to properties files itself not taking also ,so  we can configure properties file also.
To Fix this issue:
configured the view resolver using WebMvcConfigurationSupport class and mentioned the prefix and suffix using java file and it worked fine.
